        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>General note and mandatory information</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Designation of the responsible body</strong></p>
        <p>The place responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p><span id="s3-t-firma">HeroPixels GbR</span><br><span id="s3-t-strasse">Birkenweg 8 </span><br><span id="s3-t-plz">89195</span> <span id="s3-t-ort">Staig</span></p><p></p>
        <p>E-mail: all@heropixels.net<br>Phone: +49 (0) 157 73504226</p>

        <p>The responsible body decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, contact details, etc.)</p>

        <p><strong>Revocation of your consent to data processing</strong><br>Only with your express consent are some data processing operations possible. A revocation of your already given consent is possible at any time. An informal notification by e-mail is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to appeal to the competent supervisory authority</strong><br>As a data subject, you have the right to complain to the competent supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data protection law. The competent supervisory authority with regard to data protection issues is the State Data Protection Commissioner of the federal state in which our company is located. The following link provides a list of the data protection officers and their contact details: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to data transferability</strong><br>You have the right to have data, which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract, handed over to you or to third parties. The data will be provided in a machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>

        <p><strong>Right to information, correction, blocking, deletion</strong><br>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, the origin of the data, its recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct, block or delete this data. In this regard and also for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time using the contact options listed in the imprint.</p>

        <p><strong>SSL or TLS encryption</strong><br>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data that you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the "https://" address line of your browser and the lock symbol in the browser line.</p>

            Data transmission upon conclusion of a contract for the purchase and dispatch of goods
            
            Personal data will only be transferred to third parties if necessary in the context of the contract. Third parties can be, for example, payment service providers or logistics companies. A further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you have expressly agreed to it.

        <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
            Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your end device. Cookies help us to make our offer more user-friendly, effective and safer.
            
            Some cookies are "session cookies." Such cookies are deleted automatically after the end of your browser session. On the other hand, other cookies remain on your terminal device until you delete them yourself. Such cookies help us to recognize you when you return to our website.
            
            With a modern web browser you can monitor, restrict or prevent the setting of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured so that cookies are deleted automatically when you close the program. Disabling cookies may result in limited functionality of our website.
            
            The setting of cookies, which are necessary for electronic communication processes or the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g. shopping basket), is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f DSGVO. As operators of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of our services. If other cookies are set (e.g. for analysis functions), these will be treated separately in this data protection declaration.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>
            Our website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider of the web analysis service is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

                Google Analytics uses "cookies." These are small text files that your web browser stores on your end device and enable an analysis of website use. Information generated by cookies about your use of our website is transmitted to a Google server and stored there. Server location is usually the USA.
                
                The setting of Google Analytics cookies is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise our website and, where applicable, advertising.
                
                IP anonymisation
                
                We use Google Analytics in conjunction with the IP anonymisation function. It ensures that Google truncates your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before sending it to the USA. There may be exceptional cases in which Google transfers the full IP address to a server in the USA and shortens it there. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports on website activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
                
                Browser Plugin
                
                The setting of cookies by your web browser can be prevented. However, some functions of our website could be restricted as a result. You can also prevent the collection of data regarding your website usage, including your IP address and subsequent processing by Google. This is possible by downloading and installing the browser plugin accessible via the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.
                
                Objection to data collection
                
                You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent the collection of your information on future visits to our site: Disable Google Analytics.

                Order processing
                
                In order to fully comply with the legal data protection requirements, we have concluded a contract with Google for order processing.
                
                Demographic characteristics at Google Analytics
                
                Our website uses the "demographic features" function of Google Analytics. It can be used to generate reports that contain information about the age, gender and interests of visitors to the site. This data is derived from interest-based advertising by Google and from visitor data from third parties. It is not possible to assign the data to a specific person. You can disable this feature at any time. You can do this through the ad settings in your Google Account or by generally prohibiting the collection of your data by Google Analytics, as explained in the "Opting out of data collection" section.

                With the help of the "Sofortüberweisung" procedure, we receive a payment confirmation from Sofort GmbH in real time and can immediately begin to fulfill our obligations.
                
                When paying by "Sofortüberweisung", your PIN and TAN are transmitted to Sofort GmbH.

Your turnover, the credit limit of your overdraft facility and the existence of other accounts and their balances are also automatically checked after logging in.
                
                In addition to PIN and TAN, the transfer to Sofort GmbH also includes payment data as well as data about your person. The personal data includes first and last name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address, IP address and, if applicable, other data necessary for payment processing. There is a need for this data transmission to determine your identity beyond doubt and to prevent fraud attempts.
                
                The transmission of your data to Sofort GmbH takes place on the basis of art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent) and art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO (processing to fulfill a contract). A revocation of your already given consent is possible at any time. Data processing operations in the past remain effective in the event of revocation.
